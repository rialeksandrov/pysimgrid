  Opportunistic load balancing scheduler.

  Dynamically schedule a free task on a fastest host, disregarding any communication costs.
  Main practical advantage is avoiding any attempts to estimate task performance on given machine.

  Can be considered baseline algorithm for benchmarking purposes as one of the simplest approaches
  that actually make sense for DAG scheduling.
